    <p>
      This is a free, open-source tool designed to help Californians navigate the Small Claims Court system.
      Our mission is to make justice more accessible by simplifying the form-filling process.
    </p>

    <h2>Why We Built This</h2>
    <p>
      Small Claims Court is designed to be accessible without a lawyer, but the paperwork can still be
      intimidating. We created this tool to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Make forms easier to understand with helpful explanations</li>
      <li>Reduce errors by validating your entries</li>
      <li>Save time by auto-filling related forms</li>
      <li>Generate properly formatted PDFs ready for court</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Open Source</h2>
    <p>
      This project is released under the MIT License. You can view, contribute to, or fork the code
      on GitHub. We welcome contributions from developers, legal professionals, and anyone who wants
      to help improve access to justice.
    </p>

    <h2>Not Legal Advice</h2>
    <p>
      This tool provides form assistance only. It is not a substitute for legal advice. If you have
      questions about your legal rights or the best strategy for your case, please consult with an
      attorney or visit the California Courts Self-Help Center.
