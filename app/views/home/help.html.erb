      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">What is Small Claims Court?</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600">
        Small Claims Court is a special court where disputes are resolved quickly and inexpensively.
        In California, you can sue for up to $12,500 (or $6,250 if you're a business). You don't need
        a lawyer, and the rules are simplified to make it easier to represent yourself.

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Which form do I need?</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600">
        If you're suing someone, start with <strong>SC-100</strong> (Plaintiff's Claim). If you've been
        sued and want to file a counter-claim, use <strong>SC-120</strong>. After filing, you'll need
        <strong>SC-104</strong> (Proof of Service) to prove you properly notified the other party.

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Is this an official court website?</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600">
        No, this is an independent, open-source project. We use the official court form templates
        provided by the California Courts, but we are not affiliated with the courts. The forms we
        generate are identical to those you'd download from courts.ca.gov.
